PLCK-23#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	PLL100to8/inst/clkin1_ibufg (IBUF.O) is locked to L5
	PLL100to8/inst/mmcm_adv_inst (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) cannot be placed

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 tbs_core_0/spike_memory_0/gen_dual_ram.dual_ram_0/mem_reg has an input control pin tbs_core_0/spike_memory_0/gen_dual_ram.dual_ram_0/mem_reg/RSTREGARSTREG (net: tbs_core_0/spike_memory_0/gen_dual_ram.dual_ram_0/reset_entity) which is driven by a register (tbs_core_0/adaptive_mode_d_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
