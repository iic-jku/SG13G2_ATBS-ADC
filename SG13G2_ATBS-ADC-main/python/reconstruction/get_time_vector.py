    Description: Calculates the time vector for a given spike sequence.
                 The absolute value of the spikes gives the current timer value.
                 A zero marks a timer overflow.
                 
    Parameters:
        spikes (numpy.ndarray): (8*nbytes)-Bit signed data with overflow zeros.
        time_counter_bitwidth (int): Bitwidth of time unit counter.
    
    Returns:
        list of int: time vector for a given spike sequence.
